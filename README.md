# Python solutions

## Running
The solutions are using a shared Common library, used usually for the IO operations. If you'd like to run a script, please:
1. Add the `Python` folder to the PYTHONPATH environment variable
2. Run the specified day from inside this day's folder (so it can find the input file)

Alternatively, the `run_day.py` script can do that for you. Just run it with the first argument as the day number like this
```
python run_day.py 5
```
